    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Lasagna is a classic <strong>Italian dish</strong> made of layers of flat
      pasta sheets, rich meat or vegetable sauce, and creamy cheese. Typically
      baked until golden and bubbly, it's a hearty, comforting meal with deep
      flavors. The combination of tangy tomato sauce, seasoned meat, and melted
      cheese makes it a favorite for family dinners and gatherings. Variations
      include vegetarian options with spinach or eggplant, or different cheeses
      like ricotta and mozzarella. It's a satisfying dish that's loved worldwide
      for its warmth and taste.
